TODOs:
	- fix screen swap on faint from status
	- battle may end if pokemon faints from status
	- fix faint from confusion
	- fix HPBar (brackey's)
	- force player to walk within map bounds
	- Status conditions are always coded to only affect target (e.g. Burn can't affect SELF), should also have a target variable in Effects (not just Secondary Effects) (this is in any move prefab)
	- Should state already statused if another status move is used, even if it misses
		- When this condition is met, ensure that the pokemon named is the right one
	- Moves that target SELF still have attack animation and opponent still has attack animation 
	- Fix all battle dialogue's to be skippable with space bar
	- Implement Struggle if pokemon has 0 PP in all moves
	- Implement a volatile status counter for each volatile status (e.g. you can be confused and perish song'd at the same time)
	- Fix HP text on BattleHUD (overflow)
	- Fix Player and Enemy Battle HUD graphics
	- Add dialogue to allow player to say no to learning a new move instead of selecting to forget the new move
	- Fix tiling issues with sizes of tile vs camera view in different scenes
	- Reset Action Selector position on battle end
	- Don't allow pokemon to learn a move it already knows
	- Save position and defeated state of trainers
	- Change text for 4x weakness to 'extremly effective'
	- Continue Saving Party from 31:00, error with null during save
	- Remove SampleScene Global Objects and add the Global Loader, ensure that the SavingSystem is retained
