TODOs:
	- fix screen swap on faint from status
	- battle may end if pokemon faints from status
	- fix faint from confusion
	- fix HPBar (brackey's)
	- on battle start if opp is faster, they attack before move is picked
	- force player to walk within map bounds
	- allow to skip current stage of turn by pressing space bar
	- Volatile conditions are always coded to only affect target (e.g. Burn can't affect SELF), should also have a target variable in Effects (not just Secondary Effects) (this is in any move prefab)
