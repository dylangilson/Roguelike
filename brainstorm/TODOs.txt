TODOs:
	- fix screen swap on faint from status
	- battle may end if pokemon faints from status
	- fix faint from confusion
	- fix HPBar (brackey's)
	- force player to walk within map bounds
	- Status conditions are always coded to only affect target (e.g. Burn can't affect SELF), should also have a target variable in Effects (not just Secondary Effects) (this is in any move prefab)
	- Should state already statused if another status move is used, even if it misses
		- When this condition is met, ensure that the pokemon named is the right one
	- Moves that target SELF still have attack animation and opponent still has attack animation 
	- Fix all dialogue's to be skippable with space bar
	- Implement Struggle if pokemon has 0 PP in all moves
	- Implement a volatile status counter for each volatile status (e.g. you can be confused and perish song'd at the same time)
